# ARCHITECTURE.md

## Role
You are an expert Senior Full-Stack Engineer and Architect specializing in high-performance Single Page Applications (SPA).

## Task
Generate code, resolve issues, and extend features for our project strictly adhered to the designated tech stack and architectural constraints outlined below. Do not deviate or introduce unapproved third-party dependencies.

---

## 1. Core Tech Stack & Architectural Vision
This project is built as a highly cohesive, loosely coupled Single Page Application (SPA). All code generation, modifications, and refactoring tasks must strictly adhere to the following tech stack. Alternative third-party libraries are strictly prohibited unless explicitly requested:

*   **Core Framework**: Vue 3 (Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax)
*   **Build Tool**: Vite
*   **Routing**: Vue Router (Centralized setup with module-based auto-aggregation)
*   **State Management**: Pinia (Decentralized, independent stores; Setup-store pattern)
*   **Network Requests**: Axios (Base configuration wrapper + domain-isolated APIs)

### 🧱 Component Building Principles
*   **Logic Separation**: UI rendering must be decoupled from business logic. Complex state and methods must be extracted into composable functions (Hooks) inside `hooks/` directories.
*   **High Cohesion, Low Coupling**: Components must remain highly independent. Use standard `props` and `emits` for communication. Avoid implicit cross-module dependencies.

## 2. 🛑 Strict Architectural & Tech Stack Constraints

### 2.1 Backend Database
- PostgreSQL (Latest stable version).
- All migrations must use **Alembic**. No raw SQL or manual schema updates.

### 2.2 Backend API Framework
- **FastAPI** leveraging Python's `async/await` throughout the entire data flow.
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0+** as the ORM, utilizing the modern `Mapped[...]` and `mapped_column()` type-annotated declarations. Do not use deprecated v1.x syntaxes.
- Use `AsyncSession` for all database interactions.

### 2.3 API Response Standardization
- All responses must be wrapped globally in a generic Pydantic schema containing:
  `code: int` (business status code), `message: str`, and `data: Optional[T] = None`.
- Properly handle pagination via a specialized nested Pydantic generic model.

### 2.4 Frontend Architecture
- **Vue 3** (Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax) + **TypeScript** + **Tailwind CSS** + **Lucide Icons** (imported via 'lucide-vue-next').
- Build Tool: **Vite** with strict configuration of reverse proxy (`/api`) to eliminate CORS issues during development.

### 2.5 API Client & Type Generation (SSOT)
- Front-end must NEVER write raw HTTP fetch/axios requests or duplicate TypeScript interfaces manually.
- Generate all frontend clients and TypeScript interfaces automatically from FastAPI's `/openapi.json` using `@hey-api/openapi-ts`.

### 2.6 Authentication & Security
- Stateless **JWT-based authentication** using a Dual-Token system (Short-lived `Access Token` passed in HTTP header, long-lived `Refresh Token`).
- Implement a silent, seamless token refresh mechanism via frontend interceptors to prevent user interruption upon Access Token expiration.

### 2.7 Advanced Form & Chart Extensions
- Leverage **VueUse** composables for all reactive window/element handling, debouncing, and v-model bindings.
- Use **vue-echarts** (with granular tree-shaking/on-demand imports of ECharts modules) for all data visualizations.

### 2.8 Database-Level Pagination and Indexing Rule
All APIs that support paginated queries **MUST implement pagination at the database layer**, not by retrieving all rows into application memory and slicing them. Pagination logic should calculate total row counts and apply SQL `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` (or equivalent) clauses directly in the database query.

For tables involved in paginated queries, **appropriate indexes MUST be created** to optimize query performance. Indexing strategies can include:

- Composite indexes on columns used for filtering, sorting, and joining.
- Inclusion of non-key columns using `INCLUDE` clauses (or database-specific equivalent) to cover frequently selected columns and reduce lookups.
- Other database-supported optimizations such as partial indexes, filtered indexes, or clustered indexes when appropriate.

Code generators and AI agents **MUST ensure** that:

1. Pagination is expressed in the SQL query or ORM equivalent, not in-memory post-processing.
2. Indexes are recommended or created to support the paginated access patterns.
3. Total row count is retrieved efficiently, e.g., via a `COUNT(*)` query with the same filter conditions.
4. Queries remain performant and scalable as table size grows, avoiding full table scans where possible.

### 2.9 Aggregation and Computation at the Database Layer Rule

All operations involving aggregation, summarization, or computation over database tables **MUST be performed within the database engine** itself, using SQL constructs (e.g., `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`) or equivalent database-supported functions.

**Strict prohibitions and requirements:**

1. **No in-memory aggregation:** Do **not** load full tables or large datasets into application memory to compute totals, averages, counts, or other aggregates.
2. **Leverage database optimization:** Use database indexes, partitioning, materialized views, or query hints to maximize performance for aggregation queries.
3. **Handle large datasets efficiently:** Ensure queries scale with table size and leverage database-level filtering, joining, and aggregation to minimize memory usage and network transfer.
4. **Preserve data integrity:** Aggregation queries must respect constraints, filtering, and business logic defined at the database layer.
5. **Transaction consistency:** Aggregations that require consistency should be executed within proper transactional context or use snapshot/isolation levels supported by the database.

The AI coding agent **MUST** follow this rule for any code generation involving aggregated computations, without exception.

### 3.0 Soft-Deleted Business-Key Recreation Rule
When implementing any create/upsert flow for an entity that supports soft deletion, the code **MUST NOT** reject the request with a simple “already exists” / duplicate-business-key error solely because a soft-deleted row exists with the same business key.

A **business key** means a deterministic domain identifier supplied or derived from business data, not an auto-generated random primary key, UUID, database sequence, or surrogate ID.

If a create request uses a business key that matches an existing soft-deleted row, and making that data effective again can be done without violating data integrity rules, uniqueness rules, or database foreign-key constraints, the implementation **MUST** treat the request as a valid business flow and make the data effective again.

Acceptable implementation strategies include, but are not limited to:

- restoring/reactivating the existing soft-deleted row;
- clearing soft-delete fields such as `deleted`, `deleted_at`, `deleted_by`, `delete_reason`, or equivalent fields;
- updating the restored row with the new request data according to normal create/update validation rules;
- creating a replacement row only when the domain model and database constraints allow it;
- using a domain-specific recovery/recreation workflow that results in the requested business data becoming active/effective.

The implementation **MUST** follow this decision order:

1. If an active row already exists with the same business key, reject the request as a duplicate, unless the API is explicitly defined as idempotent or upsert-like.
2. If only soft-deleted row(s) exist with the same business key, do not return a duplicate error by default.
3. Validate the incoming request exactly as a normal create request would be validated.
4. Determine whether the soft-deleted data can be restored, replaced, or otherwise made effective without breaking database constraints, foreign-key relationships, audit requirements, or domain invariants.
5. If it is safe, make the data effective using the domain-appropriate strategy.
6. If it is not safe, fail with a specific integrity/domain-state error explaining why recreation is not allowed, not with a generic “already exists” error.

Implementations **MUST** query soft-deleted rows when checking business-key uniqueness. A uniqueness check that only looks at active rows is insufficient if the database has unique constraints that still include soft-deleted rows.

Implementations **MUST** handle concurrency safely. The check-and-restore/create operation should be performed in a transaction using the project’s standard locking, upsert, or conflict-handling pattern so that concurrent requests cannot create duplicate active business keys.

Implementations **MUST NOT** work around this rule by mutating the business key, appending random suffixes, generating a new business identifier, bypassing validation, disabling constraints, or physically deleting historical data unless the domain explicitly requires that behavior.

Tests for create/upsert behavior on soft-deletable entities **MUST** include the case where a soft-deleted row with the same business key already exists and the expected result is that the requested data becomes active/effective rather than receiving a duplicate-exists error.

## 4. Progressive Development & "Zero-Interference" Safeguards
To guarantee that newly added features never break or interfere with existing production modules, the AI must implement the following isolation strategies:

### 🔌 4.1 Interface Isolation: Module-Based API Management
*   **Global Foundation**: Global JWT interceptors and unified error handling are mounted on the generated client at `src/api/generated/client.ts`. A hand-written `src/utils/request.ts` is forbidden (per §2.5).
*   **Local Autonomy**: Creating a massive, unified global `api.ts` file is strictly forbidden. Each business module's `views/[module_name]/api/index.ts` re-exports only the subset of generated functions and TypeScript types it consumes from `src/api/generated/`. Hand-rolled fetch/axios calls inside modules are forbidden.
*   **Dependency Direction**: Pages can only import APIs from their own module's `api/index.ts` or explicitly designated global shared services.

### 🛣️ 4.2 Routing Isolation: Dynamic Module Registration
*   `src/router/index.ts` must use Vite's `import.meta.glob` to automatically scan and register route configurations from the `modules/` directory.
*   **Adding Features**: To add a new domain, create a new `[module_name].ts` file inside `src/router/modules/`. **Modifying the main router file (`index.ts`) directly is prohibited**.

### 🧩 4.3 Component & State Isolation
*   **The Locality Principle**: Do not lift a component or a Pinia store to global directories (`src/components/` or `src/store/modules/`) unless it is explicitly confirmed to be reused across at least **3 separate** business modules.
*   **Destruction Safety**: The system architecture must guarantee that running `rm -rf src/views/[module_name]` along with removing its respective route file allows the project to compile with zero errors and leave no trace of dead code.

## 5. Development Workflow & DevOps
- The entire stack (Vue 3 dev server + FastAPI hot-reload + PostgreSQL 15+) must be orchestrated via a single **Docker Compose** file (`docker-compose.yml`) ensuring instant local environment setup.

---

## 6. AI Execution Constraints
When a code generation or modification prompt is received, the AI must execute the following self-check sequence:
1.  **Identify Boundaries**: Determine which specific `[module_name]` the task belongs to. If it is a completely new feature, scaffold a new directory under `views/`.
2.  **Protect Global Scope**: Unless explicitly commanded to refactor, do not modify files in `src/components/`, other unrelated business modules, or global utility files.
3.  **Code Style Consistency**: Always use TypeScript with `<script setup lang="ts">` syntax. Ensure strong typing for Axios response schemas and component Props.

---

## 7. 💡 Output Expectation
When writing or reviewing code, always enforce type safety, use async best practices on the backend, ensure proper reactivity on the frontend, and verify that the data schemas align perfectly across the network boundaries.
